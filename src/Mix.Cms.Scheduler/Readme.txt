Trigger objects are used to trigger the execution (or ‘firing’) of jobs. When you wish to schedule a job, you instantiate a trigger and ‘tune’ its properties to provide the scheduling you wish to have. Triggers may also have a JobDataMap associated with them - this is useful to passing parameters to a Job that are specific to the firings of the trigger. Quartz ships with a handful of different trigger types, but the most commonly used types are SimpleTrigger (interface ISimpleTrigger) and CronTrigger (interface ICronTrigger).


For example, Jobs can be created and stored in the job scheduler independent of a trigger, and many triggers can be associated with the same job. Another benefit of this loose-coupling is the ability to configure jobs that remain in the scheduler after their associated triggers have expired, so that that it can be rescheduled later, without having to re-define it. It also allows you to modify or replace a trigger without having to re-define its associated job.
